# My Take
When participating in a hackathon, Here are the list of things you should know and use it to maximize your chances according to me but it may vary from person to person.

## Git Commands: Here is list of command I think you should be aware of

git clone: Clone a repository to your local machine.  
git add: Stage changes or new files for commit.  
git commit: Commit changes with a descriptive message.  
git push: Push your committed changes to a remote repository.  
git pull: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.  
git branch: Create, list, or switch between branches.  
git merge: Merge changes from one branch into another.  
git rebase: Reapply commits on top of another base commit.  

## Commits and Descriptions: Make meaningful commits and provide in short the description of commit
Make frequent and meaningful commits, focusing on small, logical changes. Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose and impact of the commit. For example:

```
git commit -m "Add user authentication functionality"
```

## README: Add your project working descrition, guideline for contribution, local setup and all things that are need to know about your project
Create a detailed README.md file that provides information about your project, including installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant details. Use formatting, headers, and bullet points to improve readability.

## Branches: Create Branches for Collabaration in Hackathon so that it's don't conflict the main branch.
Utilize branches to work on different features or aspects of your project concurrently. This allows for parallel development without interfering with the main branch (usually master or main). Create a new branch using:

```
git branch new-feature
```

## Issues: Use Issue if you think something is needed to be updated, provide new features, assign issues
Use GitHub's issue tracker to manage tasks, track bugs, or suggest enhancements. Create new issues, assign them to team members, and provide relevant details. This helps organize and prioritize work within your team.

## GitHub Codespaces (for students): If your student and have applied to Github Developer Pack then You shouldddddd use CodeSpaces
If you're a student, take advantage of GitHub Codespaces. It provides a cloud-based development environment directly in your browser, eliminating the need for local setups. You can write, compile, and test your code without worrying about installing dependencies or configuring environments.
